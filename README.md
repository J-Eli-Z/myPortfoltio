# myPortfoltio
A short introduction of myself: 
I am a persistent person on my works, I don't give up in the middle. Once I've made my decision on doing a project, I give it my all and do it 'till I made it.
I am bilingual. I'm proficient in both Indonesian and English.
I am someone that's diligent and hardworking. Other than that, I'm also curious about the things I'm working on. 
I don't give up on facing new challenges. When there's some challenges in my way, I will find the solutions and work things out properly. 

These are some of my projects I've done to build up some experience in programming.
Although, currently, my projects are mostly local projects, they represent my experience in programming.
I'm very interested in programming and hope that I could continue working in this field of work.
